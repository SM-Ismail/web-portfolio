            <h2>Become world champion web developer</h2>
            <p>I wish to be a full stack developer in future. I am working hard on it. To be precise, might I say,I have just started working on it. Learned to make a simple website using only HTML and CSS basic operations. Though I'm yet to learn Javascript. That's why my buttons don't work(in my website!! =D). Please, excuse that!!</p>

            <h2 class="part2h2">Programming Hero learner </h2>
            GitHub used to be a very tough thing indeed. I came to know this GitHub thing during my thesis work. It appeaared to me as an unbreakable wall. I could hardly understand anything. However, now doring this course of web development, I got to understand how to work with it and, I am finding real fun working with GitHub. I am yet to explore the world of developers! Excited indeed!!
